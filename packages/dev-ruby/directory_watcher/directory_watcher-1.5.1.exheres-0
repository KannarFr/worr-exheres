SUMMARY="Watches a directory for changes"
DESCRIPTION="
The directory watcher operates by scanning a directory at some interval and generating a list of
files based on a user supplied glob pattern. As the file list changes from one interval to the next,
events are generated and dispatched to registered observers. Three types of events are supported --
added, modified, and removed.
