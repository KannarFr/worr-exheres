SUMMARY="Capture STDOUT and STDERR from Perl, XS or external programs"
DESCRIPTION="
Capture::Tiny provides a simple, portable way to capture almost anything
sent to STDOUT or STDERR, regardless of whether it comes from Perl,
from XS code or from an external program. Optionally, output can be
teed so that it is captured while being passed through to the original
filehandles. Yes, it even works on Windows (usually). Stop guessing
which of a dozen capturing modules to use in any particular situation
and just use this one.
