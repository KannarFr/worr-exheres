SUMMARY="Exclude files/directories for Version Control Systems"
DESCRIPTION="
Many tools need to be equally useful both on ordinary files, and on code that
has been checked out from revision control systems. File::Find::Rule::VCS
provides quick and convenient methods to exclude the version control directories
of several major Version Control Systems (currently CVS, subversion, and
Bazaar).
