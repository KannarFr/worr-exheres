SUMMARY="Install shared files"
DESCRIPTION="
File::ShareDir::Install allows you to install read-only data files
from a distribution. It is a companion module to File::ShareDir, which
allows you to locate these files after installation. It is a port of
Module::Install::Share to ExtUtils::MakeMaker with the improvement of only
installing the files you want; ".svn", ".git" and other source-control
junk will be ignored. Please note that this module installs read-only
data files; empty directories will be ignored.
