SUMMARY="Getopt::Long, but simpler and more powerful"
DESCRIPTION="
Getopt::Long::Descriptive is yet another Getopt library. It's built atop
Getopt::Long, and gets a lot of its features, but tries to avoid making
you think about its huge array of options. It also provides usage (help)
messages, data validation, and a few other useful features.
