SUMMARY="Tool to ease Perl module distribution building"
DESCRIPTION="
Dist::Zilla is a program to make it easier to write, package, manage, and 
release free software.  It's targeted at libraries written in the Perl 
programming language and released to the CPAN. If you release software to 
the CPAN, Dist::Zilla can probably save you a lot of work. It has plugins to
automate dozens of boring steps.
