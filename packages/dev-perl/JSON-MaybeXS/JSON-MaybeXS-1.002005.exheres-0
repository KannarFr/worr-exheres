SUMMARY="Use Cpanel::JSON::XS with a fallback to JSON::XS and JSON::PP"
DESCRIPTION=" This module first checks to see if either Cpanel::JSON::XS or
JSON::XS is already loaded, in which case it uses that module. Otherwise it
tries to load Cpanel::JSON::XS, then JSON::XS, then JSON::PP in order, and
either uses the first module it finds or throws an error. It then exports
the "encode_json" and "decode_json" functions from the loaded module,
along with a "JSON" constant that returns the class name for calling "new"
on. If you're writing fresh code rather than replacing JSON.pm usage,
you might want to pass options as constructor args rather than calling
mutators, so we provide our own "new" method that supports that.  "
