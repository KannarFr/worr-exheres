SUMMARY="Validate your CPAN META.yml files."
DESCRIPTION="
This distribution was written to ensure that a META.yml file, provided
with a standard distribution uploaded to CPAN, meets the specifications
that are slowly being introduced to module uploads, via the use of package
makers and installers such as ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Build and
Module::Install. See CPAN::Meta for further details of the CPAN Meta
Specification.
