SUMMARY="write-once, read-many attributes for Moose"
DESCRIPTION="
The 'SetOnce' attribute lets your class have attributes that are not
lazy and not set, but that cannot be altered once set. The logic is very
simple: if you try to alter the value of an attribute with the SetOnce
trait, either by accessor or writer, and the attribute has a value, it
will throw an exception. If the attribute has a clearer, you may clear
the attribute and set it again.
